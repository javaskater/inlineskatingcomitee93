# A new Worpdress Theme for the [InlineSkating Comittee of Seine Saint Denis](http://rollersports93.fr/)

## Paris Area France

## Worpdress theme based on [wp-bootstrap-starter](https://fr.wordpress.org/themes/wp-bootstrap-starter/)

* I wanted to create a theme based on the [latest version of Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
  * actually [Bootstrap4 Beta2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* I didn't want to start it from scratch
  * So I searched for a starter Theme
* https://fr.wordpress.org/themes/wp-bootstrap-starter/ seems to be well rated !!!

### making it as professional as possible

* a professional (but free) theme  using Bootstrap is [Newspaper x](https://fr.wordpress.org/themes/newspaper-x/)
  * It will be the target to reach starting from [wp-bootstrap-starter](https://fr.wordpress.org/themes/wp-bootstrap-starter/)!!!

### Compiling Bootstrap4 with SASS

 * I don't want to write css from scratch 
 * I also wanted to use an analogous [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) tooling
   * Analogeous to the put into place for [My Personal Portal](https://github.com/javaskater/personal_portal) 
 * For installing the nodejs and compiling SASS to css see: [Node.js page](docs/NODE.md)

 ## maintain a list of issues:

* create a .gitignore ...
* The menu / Burger does not appear clearly when using one's mobile
* I don't know how to make logos disappear when entering mobile mode
* The purple font on the banner is not OK ...
  * Can I change the banner for a Bootstrap 4 accordion or [an OWL Carousel](https://github.com/mikaelmeulle/owl)
