# Making a [pot file](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers)


* Following that [worpdress's codex page](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers)

## Getting the tools

* It has to be __check-outed__ at the wordpress's root
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar
```

## Generating your first pot file:

```bash
php wp-cli.phar i18n make-pot wordpress/wp-content/themes/inlineskatingcomitee93/languages/ wordpress/wp-content/themes/inlineskatingcomitee93/languages/inlineskatingcomitee93.pot
```
## Important, translating po to mo file
* we follow the recommendation at the wordpress codex page
```bash
jpmena@jpmena-P34:~/CDRS/wordpress/wp-content/themes/inlineskatingcomitee93/languages$ for file in `find . -name "*.po"` ; do msgfmt -o ${file/.po/.mo} $file ; done
```
### still one problem
* the __msgctxt__ tag in my po file is not accepted  il creates syntax errors
